Friends Forever

Once upon a time, there lived a mouse and a frog, who were the best of friends. Every morning, the frog would hop out of the pond to visit the mouse, 
who lived inside the hole of the tree. He would spend time with the mouse and go back home. 

One day, the frog realised that he was making too much of an effort to visit the mouse while the mouse never came to meet him at the pond.

This made him angry, and he decided to make things right by forcefully taking him to his house. When the mouse wasn’t looking, the frog tied a string to the 
mouse’s tail and tied the other end to his own leg, and hopped away. 

The mouse started getting dragged with him.

Then, the frog jumped into the pond to swim. 

However, when he looked back, he saw that the mouse had started to drown and was struggling to breathe! The frog quickly untied the string from 
his tail and took him to the shore. Seeing the mouse with his eyes barely open made the frog very sad, and he immediately regretted pulling him 
into the pond.

MORAL : Don't take revenge it might be harmful to you.

   suddenly an eagle swopped down from the sky .i tpounched on a little lamp and carried it off so swiftly that none of the other lambs even had the time to bleat. 
   The sleeping Shepherd heard nothing.
   
   A Crow was sitting on the tree under which the Shepherd lay asleep. 
   He had seen how the Eagle had caught the lamb and carried it off to his nest.

 Then the eagle and his children ate the sheep. This is small snapshot of the food chain cycle.For decades now humans were on the top of the food chain but not anymore.
A shapeship crashed on earth a while ago and it brought aliens with it.They look different from us. Their body is smaller, they less food to sustain and overall were very cute looking creatures but don't get fooled by thier looks they can eat a full grown human in less than a second and digest it in another for quick supply of energy.

The Ram was large. He was much too heavy for the Crow to carry. 
The Crow tried again and again, but without success.

The Ram felt the Crow on its back and was most annoyed. Just what do you think you are doing, you pesky bird?' 
he snapped, glaring at him over his shoulder.

The Crow flapped harder still, trying to carry the Ram away.

‘Now stop that!' cried the Ram. ‘Go away! Shoo! Leave me in peace!’ He jumped and bucked and tried to shake the Crow off his back.

Hi, readers!

Timmie Willie is a country mouse who is accidentally transported to a city in a vegetable basket.
When he wakes up, he finds himself in a party and makes a friend.
When he is unable to bear the city life, he returns to his home but invites his friend to the village.
When his friend visits him, something similar happens.

Humans have been living without cities or villages for most of history.
That means that both village and city life are recent inventions.
And just like every other invention, we need to decide their costs and benefits.

This popular story is about a hare , which is known to move quickly and a tortoise, which is known to move slower.

The story began when the hare who has won many races proposed a race with the tortoise. The hare simply wanted to prove that he was the best and have the satisfaction of beating him.

The tortoise agreed and the race began.

The hare got a head-start but became overconfident towards the end of the race. His ego made him believe that he could win the race even if he rested for a while.

--Gagan
The moral of the story is 'Slow and Steady wins the race'
So from this story we have learnt useful message for life . Let's follow this .thank you.
